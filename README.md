Chess AI Experiment

Note: I am not trying to create the most efficient or powerful chess AI. This is simply a project intended to help me understand the concepts behind machine learning and AI on a deeper level.

Currently, I am building a simple chess engine from scratch in C++. I am doing this to practice several things: problem solving, algorithm writing, data abstraction, and unit testing. 
Because this is just a learning experience, I am refraining from copying any code whatsoever. Therefore, there will likely be several things that can be imporved upon, made more efficient, easier to read, etc.
All of these issues will be addressed in time, after I do as much as I can on my own.

Once the chess engine is complete, I will start working on a chess AI. The ultimate goal of this project is to learn different machine learning algorithms and apply them to chess. Therefore, once I have completed the chess engine, I will modify it to uphold official standards, and I will build the AI to uphold the same standards. 

I have not looked into the specifc algorithms I will be using yet, but my plan for each is as follows:

1. study the algorithm and look at examples
2. plan how I want to implement the algorithm
3. code my version of the algorithm
4. test and modify

If my version of the algorithm does not work, I will do more research and modify the code as necessary.
